# Matt's dotfiles

This repo borrows heavily from Mathias Bynens's [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and Dries Vints's [dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `02-brew.sh`. If you don't plan to run `02-brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.

### Quick instructions overview

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the Mac App Store
1. (Optional, not needed if not doing iOS or Mac app development) Install Xcode from the Mac App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
1. Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and `chmod` to `600`
    - Set up SSH keys in Keychain ([instructions](https://github.com/jirsbek/SSH-keys-in-macOS-Sierra-keychain))
1. Clone this repo (e.g., to `~/src/dotfiles`) and `cd`
1. Run `01-bootstrap.sh` to copy necessary files (hidden and otherwise)
1. `cp .extra ~/.extra` and edit, if desired (explained below)
1. Run `02-brew.sh` to install apps (this script installs the Xcode command line tools before installing brew)
1. Run `03-macos.sh` to set up macOS preferences
1. Restart your computer
1. Run `04-python.sh` to set up a Python 3 conda environment named `py3`
1. Set up installed applications (look at `Brewfile` as a reminder of what was installed)

More details below.

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

Clone the repository wherever you want (I keep it in `~/src/dotfiles`). The bootstrapper script (`01-bootstrap.sh`) will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

`cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository, and start the installation:

```bash
source 01-bootstrap.sh
```

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here's an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don't want to commit to a public repository.

NB: `~/.extra` is included in the repo, but it is not automatically copied over by `01-bootstrap.sh`. Therefore, you'll want to run the following command and edit the new file's contents:

```bash
cp .extra ~/.extra
```

You can also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions, and aliases. It's probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/warmlogic/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae. This installs the Xcode command line developer tools, Homebrew, and everything listed in `Brewfile`.

```bash
./02-brew.sh
```

### Set macOS Preferences

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
./03-macos.sh
```

### Python/Anaconda setup

You may also want Python 3 and a number of useful packages related to data analysis (via [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)):

```bash
./04-python.sh
```

## TODO

- Create `requirements.txt` file for pip, so we can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead of individual install commands
- Consider including an [IPython startup script](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html?highlight=startup#startup-files).
- Set up "Open in Chrome" and "Open in Safari" AppleScripts, as described [here](https://www.engadget.com/2011/03/14/use-applescript-to-open-current-safari-url-in-google-chrome/).
